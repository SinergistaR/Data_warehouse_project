/* =================================================================================================
   Script: gold_data_validation.sql
   Purpose:
       - Perform validation checks on Gold layer integration and relationships.
       - Ensure data integrity after joining Silver tables into Gold dimensions and facts.

   Checks included:
       1. Duplicate detection
          - Verify that joins (CRM â†” ERP) do not introduce duplicate customer records.
          - Ensure product keys remain unique after enrichment with category data.
       2. Data integration consistency
          - Validate gender logic (CRM as master, ERP as fallback).
          - Confirm correct values flow into gold.dim_customers.
       3. Foreign key integrity
          - Ensure fact_sales only references existing dimension keys (dim_customers, dim_products).

   Notes:
       - Queries are diagnostic only (no modifications to data).
       - Expected result of duplicate and integrity checks: no rows returned.
       - Run after ETL process to validate Gold layer quality.
